            <p>The Pantheon is one of the best-preserved ancient Roman buildings and has been in continuous use throughout its history. Originally built as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome, it was completed by Emperor Hadrian and dedicated around 126 AD.</p>
            <p>The Pantheon is renowned for its large dome, which was the largest of its kind when it was built and remains the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. The building's design and its oculus, which allows natural light to illuminate the interior, have inspired architects throughout history.</p>
