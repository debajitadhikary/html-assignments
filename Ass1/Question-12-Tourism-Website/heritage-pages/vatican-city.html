            <p>Vatican City, officially Vatican City State, is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome, Italy. It is the smallest country in the world both by area and population, and it serves as the spiritual and administrative center of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Vatican City is home to numerous significant landmarks, including St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums. The city-state was established in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and it remains a key pilgrimage site for Catholics around the world.</p>
