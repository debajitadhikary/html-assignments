            <p>The Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) is one of the most famous and grand fountains in Rome. It was designed by architect Nicola Salvi and completed in 1762. The fountain is located at the junction of three roads (tre vie), which is how it got its name.</p>
            <p>The Trevi Fountain stands 26.3 meters high and 49.15 meters wide, making it one of the largest fountains in the city. It is renowned for its elaborate Baroque style, featuring a central figure of Oceanus, the god of the sea, flanked by tritons and sea horses. It is a popular tradition to toss a coin into the fountain, which is believed to ensure a return to Rome.</p>
