            <p>Piazza Navona is one of Rome's most famous and picturesque squares, renowned for its Baroque architecture and lively atmosphere. It was built on the site of the ancient Stadium of Domitian, and its shape reflects the layout of the ancient arena.</p>
            <p>The square is home to three magnificent fountains: the Fountain of the Four Rivers by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the Fountain of Neptune, and the Fountain of the Moor. The surrounding buildings, including the Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, add to the square's charm and historical significance.</p>
